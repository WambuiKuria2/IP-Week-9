# IP-Week-9

This repository contains two notebook.

The first notebook is an analysis of the titanic ship data using KNN

The second notebook is an analysis of spermbank data using Naive Bayes

Both models have managed to achieve accuracies of 80% and above before tunning. We noticed that changing the train_test split of the model
greatly affects the accuracy score, precision score, recall score and the F1 score
